# Use of neural networks for the phylodynamic study of epidemiological model

When I start my internship, I first tried to reproduce the results obtained in the Voznica's article (see presentation.pdf). My tests on the birth-death model are given in the *BD_model* folder.

Then I got down to the daunting task of simulating seasonal SEIR epidemiological model in order to generate quickly a lot of data to train neural networks. The results associated with the second and main part of the internship is in the *seasonal_SEIR_model* folder.

The *presentation.pdf* file is the slides I use during my final presentation in front of the research team.

One can use *requirement.txt* to create a conda environment with the pyhton packages that I use during this project.
